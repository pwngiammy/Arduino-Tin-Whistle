Simple Tin Whistle realized with an AT Mega processor, taken from an Arduino UNO, and a PCB.
Buttons' pin are connected to their relative pins and to a common ground.
Button presses are detected by a mouth-operated pressure sensor.
To connect the speaker i used an amplifier module from LC Tecnhology, to have a higher volume. It is connected to the speaker with a 10k Ohm resistor.
Power is provided by a 3.7V, 250 mAh battery. 

Components used:
7x Buttons
1x Speaker
1x Amplifier module 
1x 16 MHz quartz oscillator
1x 10 ÂµF capacitor
2x 22 pF capacitor
1x AT MegaA328P processor
1x Pressure sensor
1x 3.7V, 250 mAh battery
2x 10k Ohm resistor
